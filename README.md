Project Overview
This project involves the creation of an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze bank loan data. The dashboard provides insights into key metrics such as total loan applications, funded amounts, average interest rates, and debt-to-income (DTI) ratios. It aids stakeholders in understanding loan performance and making data-driven decisions.

Features

Loan Categorization: Insights into good and bad loans based on funding and repayment status.
Filters and Drill-downs: Analyze data by loan status, purpose, term, and employment length.
Visual Trends: Monthly trends for funded amounts and received payments.

Tools Used
Power BI Desktop: For data visualization and interactive dashboard design.
Data Source: Loan dataset with fields such as loan purpose, grade, funded amount, and interest rate.

Usage
Open the Power BI file (.pbix) to view the dashboard.
Use filters to customize the view for specific loan statuses, states, or purposes.
